# e-commerce-back-end
# Description
This is the final version of my e-commerce back end application. When the user adds their database name, MySQL username, and password to an .env file, they will be able to connect to the database with Sequelize. When they enter the schema and seed commands, then a database will be created and seeded with test data. When they begin the application, the server will start and the Sequelize models will be synced to the database. When they open an API GET route in Insomnia for either categories, products, or tags, they will be returned a formatted json response of all of the data associated with each route. Finally, when they attempt a post, put, or delete in Insomnia, they will be able to successfully create, update, or delete the data in the database.
